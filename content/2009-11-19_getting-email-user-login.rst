Yeah, maybe I am a bit paranoid, but I want to know in real-time who logs into
and from which address to my machines.

Since logging that to file is too much insecure (if one gets the control of
the machine, he can delete every file he wants..) I built a script that sends
me an alert e-mail each time a user logs in.

It uses mutt to compose an e-mail attaching the output of some commands.

The script is quite simple:

.. code:: bash

    #!/bin/bash

    # Login notification script

    # Place it into /etc/profile or /root/.profile to send an e-mail on user login.
    #  - uses mutt to send e-mail
    #  - sends the output of some commands as attachments:
    #    - netstat (connections/servers)
    #    - iptables (firewall configuration)
    #    - ps (processes list)
    #    - who (logged in users + hostnames)
    #  - of course, you need a configured MTA/smtp server in order to send emails.


    # --- Configuration ----------------------------------------------------

    NOTIFY_ADDR="MyUser <user@otherhost.org>"
    FROM_ADDR="Login Notify <security@myserver.net>"

    # ----------------------------------------------------------------------


    LOG_USER="$( whoami )"
    LOG_DATE="$( date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" )"
    OUT_WHO="$( who )"

    netstat -lnp > /tmp/netstat-listen
    netstat -np > /tmp/netstat
    ps afux > /tmp/processes
    who > /tmp/who
    (
    echo "--- Iptables: list rules"
    iptables -L
    echo
    echo "--- Iptables: show rules"
    iptables -S
    ) > /tmp/iptables-conf

    (
    cat <<EOF
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
      LOGIN NOTIFICATION
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Host:   $(hostname)
    User:   ${LOG_USER}
    Date:   ${LOG_DATE}
            $(date)
    Uptime: $(uptime)

    --- Logged in users ----------------------------------------------------
    ${OUT_WHO}

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Attaching other relevant system data.

    EOF
    ) | /usr/bin/mutt -s "[LOGIN-NOTIFY] $(hostname) Login of ${LOG_USER} on ${LOG_DATE}" \
      -e "my_hdr From: ${FROM_ADDR}" \
      -a /tmp/netstat-listen -a /tmp/netstat -a /tmp/processes -a /tmp/who -a /tmp/iptables-conf \
      "${NOTIFY_ADDR}"

    rm /tmp/netstat-listen /tmp/netstat /tmp/processes /tmp/who /tmp/iptables-conf

Of course, you can modify which commands are run, where to log them and which
files you want to be attached to the e-mail. Or you can add more commands
output between the two EOF, to include their output in the message body.

Once placed the script somewhere, add it to a file executed on user login,
such as ``~/.profile`` or ``/etc/profile``.

And, of course, you must have a configured mailserver installed in order to
send e-mails from your server..
