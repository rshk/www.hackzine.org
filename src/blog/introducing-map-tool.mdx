# Introducing the map tool

Ever needed to perform some simple geospatial queries, and dreaded
having to fire up a full-blown Gis software for that? It gets worse
while are on the go, and only have a small screen device available.

I finally decided to put together a simple online [Map
tool](/map-tool) to help with some of that.

It's still a bit crude at the moment, but already provides some useful
functionality.

## Current features

- **Plot markers on the map.** Point-and-click to add markers on the
  map. Shows coordinates of the selected point in decimal or DMS
  (degrees, minutes, seconds).
- **Plot current location on the map.** Use the device location to add
  a marker on the map.
- **Plot distance from a point.** Create a circle of a given radius
  around a point. This can be useful when trying to triangulate a
  position for example, given distance from various points.
  Circles are drawn on a WGS84 spheroid.
- **Plot shortest path between points.** Draw shortest-path routes
  between two points, and calculate distance (and initial bearing)
  between the two.
- **Save state to local storage.**


## Planned features

- Add point from coordinates
- Add point from starting point / bearing / distance
- Make it more mobile-friendly
- Import / export from JSON
- Save multiple files to local storage
- Shareable links
